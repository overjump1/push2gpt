# push2gpt
push2gpt is a hobby project of mine aimed at communicating with chatgpt using push to talk.
you need to install all of the imported libraries in order to make it work.
set your own openai api token in order to access their gpt models and speach to text model.
setup your google cloud auth. to learn more, visit the folllowing page: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#how-to
after everything is set up correctly, alt key is the defult key for talking to this model.
press alt key, then talk, then when you release the alt key you should wait a few seconds until you'll hear the respounce outloud.
remember, currently the script will use your defult audio sources and is very limited.

while my code isn't the best, i belieave that with the help of a community we can get this project to be much better over time.
thanks so much for using this and enjoy :D
