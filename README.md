# push2gpt
"Push2GPT" is a hobby project of mine aimed at communicating with ChatGPT using push-to-talk. 

You need to install all the imported libraries to make it work. 

Set your own OpenAI API token to access their GPT models and speech-to-text model, and set up your Google Cloud authentication. 

To learn more, please visit the following page: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#how-to. 

After everything is set up correctly, the Alt key is the default key for talking to this model. 

Press the Alt key, then talk. When you release the Alt key, wait a few seconds until you hear the response out loud. Remember, currently, the script will use your default audio sources and is very limited.

While my code isn't the best, I believe that with the help of a community, we can make this project much better over time. Thank you so much for using this, and enjoy! :D
